# Random Number Generator

This project aims to generate pseudo-random numbers that approach the elusive quality of true randomness. The process involves utilizing environmental sensors to collect real-time data and a algorithm, merging the organic and the digital to produce outcomes that escape predictability. 

This repo contains source code for a few different sensors that contribute to the random number generator.

Currently the algorithm code is being hosted on [https://5695152282714844.glitch.me/]. In order to subscribe to utilize the random number you must also have this this website open (glitch.com puts the servers to sleep if they are not being used). Hopefully in the future this will not be the case :) 

If you would like to contribute your own sensor data, use the random numbers generated in your own project, and/or have ideas for improving the algorithm please email [vgw3869@nyu.edu](mailto:vgw3869@nyu.edu?subject=Random Number Generator). 

Thanks!
