# Random Number Generator

This project was created by Gracy Whelihan as a graduate thesis project at NYU's ITP program. It aims to generate pseudo-random numbers that approach the elusive quality of true randomness. The process involves utilizing environmental sensors to collect real-time data and a algorithm, merging the organic and the digital to produce outcomes that escape predictability. 

This repo contains source code for a few different sensors that contribute to the random number generator.

Currently the algorithm code is being hosted [here](https://5695152282714844.glitch.me/). In order to subscribe to utilize the random number you must also have this this website open ([glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) puts the servers to sleep if they are not being used). Hopefully in the future this will not be the case :) 

If you would like to contribute your own sensor data, use the random numbers generated in your own project, and/or have ideas for improving the algorithm please email [vgw3869@nyu.edu](mailto:vgw3869@nyu.edu?). 

Thanks!
