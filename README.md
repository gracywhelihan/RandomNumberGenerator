# Random Number Generator

This project was created by Gracy Whelihan as a graduate thesis project at NYU's ITP program. It aims to generate pseudo-random numbers that approach the elusive quality of true randomness. The process involves utilizing environmental sensors to collect real-time data and a algorithm, merging the organic and the digital to produce outcomes that escape predictability. 

This repo contains source code for a few different sensors that contribute to the random number generator.

Currently the algorithm code is being hosted [here](https://5695152282714844.glitch.me/). 

To use the random numbers that are being generate, you can either subscribe as a mqtt client, or make an api call to the site.
NOTE: Numbers can only be generated about once per second, it may not be ideal if needed for super fast generation.

If you would like to contribute your own sensor data, use the random numbers generated in your own project, and/or have ideas for improving the algorithm please email <vgw3869@nyu.edu>. 

Thanks!
