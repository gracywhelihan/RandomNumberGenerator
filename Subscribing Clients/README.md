Code for Adruino and JS clients that subscribe to the randomnumbergenerator broker to get the random number.

NOTE: The number that is generated is a number between 0 and 1.

JS client code can also be viewed on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) and can be remixed for your own project [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prng-js-client).
